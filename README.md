### Thought on the assignemnt

In this assignement immutablejs was new thing for me it took me time to understand what is returned from api.After
spending some time on researching i found out about immutable.The other interesting feature is the autocomplite 
i haven't done that before.What took me time is laying down the sturucture of the app ,how the data flow ,which one 
should be done first.It was great assignment . thank you
